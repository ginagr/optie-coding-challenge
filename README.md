# Optie Coding Challenge 2018
----
## Overview:
For this coding challenge we are asking you to write a program that parses a JSON object containing 1000 n-grams and sorts them into different categories. The categories should be based on the definition of the words, however, the manner that they are sorted is completely up to you. This means it is up to you to figure out how to find similarities between words and group them together.

In this zip file you will find the skeleton of a single page site with blank HTML and CSS files, with the JSON object saved as *ngrams* within the JS file

---
## Setup:
1. Make sure your both the most recent versions of node and npm are installed on your computer
2. Unzip the project or fork the project
3. In your command line follow these steps:

```sh
$ cd optie-coding-challenge
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

This should start up the project and if you go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) you will see the rendered HTML file

----
## Requirements and Specs:
* You may alter index.html, scripts.js and style.css
* Do not change the JSON object provided in scripts.js
* Parse the JSON object  in the manner you choose, and display it on the HTML page
* HTML and CSS does not need to be amazing, as long as your output is clearly visible and makes sense
* NPM is already set up in the project, but you can use any other API, framework or platform you find useful as well
* Everything must be written in Javascript, HTML or CSS
* Comment lines/blocks of code that are not obvious to their purpose

Note: You may ask me up to three questions during the week. The questions can be about anything relating to this challenge. However, I will not give you a direct solution if it is too broad or unspecific. My email: gina@optieapp.com

## What to Turn In:
1. The zip file with the HTML, CSS and JS files
2. Please **do not** include the node-modules folder
2. Update this README to **briefly** explain how you came to your solution and the libraries, frameworks and steps you took to complete the challenge
3. Please name the zip file your entire name

----
## Hints:
1. Look into the [natural](https://www.npmjs.com/package/natural) or [wordpos](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wordpos) libraries
2. Focus on grouping words/phrases together
3. Don't be afraid to be creative in figuring out how to define words
4. Think about edge cases, but don't obsess
5. Content over style -> the UI matters to the extent that we need to be able to easily visually see your output. If your solution/output doesn't work or make sense, the UI will not help you fake it
6. Be aware that many n-grams may be in their own unique category with no other matches. Or that there are duplicate n-grams. It is up to you to come up with as little categories as possible though

## Solution:

To sort the Ngrams my first instinct was to make my own categories and assign key-words for those categories and then check the definitions to see if they had the keywords included. However this approach was not yielding the results I was looking for and a lot of words were getting left out and the wrong words were being included. Also, the wordpos library has many definitions for each word. So I decided to use the lexical definitions of the word to sort them. Lexical definition is defined as "of or relating to the words or vocabulary of a language, especially as distinguished from its grammatical and syntactical aspects."" The lexical definition is commonly used to explain how a word is generally used within a context.

I used the wordpos and natural libraries combined to gather all the word information and definitions. I used the wordpos.getPOS functionality to sort the words into nouns, adj, verbs, adverbs and rest, then the wordpos.lookup to find definitions and information for each ngram. I then created an object for each ngram containing the ngram, and all definitons for it. Then I searched the results and sorted them based on lexical definition into groups and exported the categories in an object to the server to display in HTML.
